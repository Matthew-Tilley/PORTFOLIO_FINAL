            <h3>Quite a curious series of events led me to where I am today.</h3>
            
            <h3>My background spans a wide range of experience; describing it as rather unconventional would be an understatement.</h3>
            
            
            <p>My introduction to the realm of digital art began nearly twenty years ago, reproducing simple vector-based logos for a small promotional products company.  Later, as co-owner of that same business, graphic design became an integral part of my full-time duties.</p>

            <p>This often leaves people a bit baffled, but most of my professional experience is in law enforcement.  (Apparently I don't "act like a cop" from what people tell me.)  Not altogether surprising from my perspective; when possible (and appropriate) I always did my best to avoid "acting like a cop" while on duty, too.</p>

            <p>During an otherwise quiet shift one evening, my law enforcement career came to an abrupt end; I had been a police officer for more than ten years.  (Although there is more to the story, the video below provides a general overview of what happened.)  Most of us d   </p>

            <p>So there I was, in my early forties, again pondering the question of "what to be when I grow up.  Thankfully, the answer came to me while watching local-interest program on PBS one evening.</p>
            
            <p>By pure senendipity, I discovered our local LaunchCode program; before long I was effectively "test-driving" various programming language under the guidance of their mentors.  At some point during that process I had an epiphany; front-end development would likely be a perfect fit for me.</p>
