                    My introduction to the realm of digital art began nearly twenty years ago, reproducing simple vector-based logos for a small promotional products company.  Later, as co-owner of that same business, graphic design became an integral part of my full-time duties.

                    This often leaves people a bit baffled, but most of my professional experience is in law enforcement.  (Numerous people have said I "don't act like a cop" when they learn of my background.)  That's really not altogether surprising from my perspective; whenever possible (and appropriate) I always did my best to avoid "acting like a cop" while on duty, too.

                    One evening, during an otherwise quiet shift, my law enforcement career came to an abrupt end; I had been a police officer for more than ten years.  Although there is more to the story (much of it quite comical, in retrospect) the video below provides a general overview of what happened.

                    As a result of that incident, we'll just say "the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound" is no longer part of my skill set.  If injuries are destined to end our career, most cops anticipate such fate will befall us in spectacular fashion; in my particular case I got taken out by a pickled sausage and a submarine sandwich.  (Yeah, can't really say as I saw that one coming.)

                    So there I was, in my early forties, again pondering the question of "what to be when I grow up."  Thankfully, the answer came to me while watching a random local-interest program on PBS one evening.

                    That's how I discovered the local LaunchCode program here in St. Louis; before long I was "test-driving" various programming languages with their help and guidance.  At some point, while building an application in the C# language, one of the mentors picked up on my penchant for creativity.  (Long story short, the "graphical interface" was highly stylized to help promote an intuitive user experience.)

                    He suggested I also exlore the web-development track, which turned out to be a good fit.  I now look forward to putting my "creative side" to good use.
